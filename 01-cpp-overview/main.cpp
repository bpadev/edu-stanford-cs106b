// 1.1 Your first C++ program
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	cout << "hello, world" << endl;
	return 0;
}


// 1.2 The history of C++
// - In 155, this IBM team produced the initial version of FORTRAN (whose name is a contraction of formula translation), which was the first example of a higher-level programming language.
// - In programming, the old order is represented by the procedural paradigm, in which programs consist of a collection of procedures and functions that operate on data.
// - The new model is called the object-oriented paradigm, in which programs are viewed instead as a collection of data objects that embody particular characteristics and behavior.
// - As a programmer, you must master many different paradigms, so that you can use the model that is most appropriate to the task at hand.


// 1.3 The compilation process
// - Source file needs to be translated into executable form.
// - The compiler program translates the source file into an object file containg the machine-language instructions.
// - This object file is then combined with other object files to produce an executable file.
// - The other object files typically included predefined object files called libraries, which contain the machine-language instructions for various operations commonly required by programs.
// - The process of combining all the individual object files into an executable file is called linking.
